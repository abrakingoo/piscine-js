/*
Create a function named firstDayWeek, which accepts a specific week in a given year:

number: representing a week of the year (between 1 and 53).
string: representing a year.
Your function should return a string representing the date of the first day of that specific week in the format dd-mm-yyyy.

Week 1 is in all cases, the week which contains the 1st of January.

The first day of a week is a Monday.

If the start of the week is in the previous year, then your function should return the first day of the specified year.
